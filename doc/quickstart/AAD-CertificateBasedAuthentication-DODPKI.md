## 1. Determine username mapping policy
For DOD Common Access Card (CAC) certificates, the `Principal Name` Subject Alternative Name (SAN) value needs to be mapped to an attribute on your Azure AD user accounts. Depending on the hybrid identity configuration, this value can be stored on either:
- [OnPremisesUserPrincipalName (synchronized users)](#onpremisessamaccountname-synchronized-users)
- [UserCertificateIds (cloud-only users)](#usercertificateids-cloud-only-users)

Use the following flow chart to determine which attribute you should use.

### Synchronized Users
When Alternate Login ID is configured with Azure AD Connect Sync, Active Directory `userPrincipalName` is synced to Azure AD `onPremisesUserPrincipalName` attribute. Since the CAC Principal Name likely matches the user's Active Directory UPN value, `onPremisesUserPrincipalName` can be used for certificate mapping.

````

### Cloud-Only Users (or combination of cloud-only and synchronized)
A new Azure AD attribute,`certificateUserIds`, is used when certificates used for CBA cannot be mapped to either userPrincipalName or OnPremisesUserPrincipalName Azure AD attributes.

Cloud-only Azure AD identities must use `certificateUserIds` mapping for DOD CAC certificates.
- OnPremisesUserPrincipalName is only for synced identities and cannot be populated on cloud-only users.
- UserPrincipalName in Azure AD has restrictions (e.g. DNS-routable domain suffix) that preclude mapping a CAC certificate to this attribute.

`certificateUserIds` is multi-valued, allowing an Azure AD user to use more than one certificate credential. The fields and value patterns are listed in the table below:

|**Certificate mapping field**|**certificateUserIds pattern**|**Example**|
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
|PrincipalName|`X509:<PN>` + `value`|`X509:<PN>123456789101112@mil`|
|RFC822Name (Email)|`X509:<RFC822>` + `value`|`X509:<RFC822>bob@contoso.com`|
|X509 Subject Key Identifier|`X509:<SKI>` + `value`|`X509:<SKI>123456789abcdef`|
|X509 SHA1 Public Key|`X509:<SHA1-PUKEY>` + `value`|`X509:<SHA1-PUKEY>123456789abcdef`|

Configure using the Azure Portal following the reference below.

> ðŸ“˜ [Certificate user IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-certificateuserids)

You may also want to use this attribute for synchronized users for scenarios where `OnPremisesUserPrincipalName` will not contain the right attribute value to match the certificate. To use Azure AD Connect to populate the attribute, see [update certificateUserIds with Azure AD Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-certificateuserids#update-certificate-user-ids-using-azure-ad-connect).

Programatic updates to userCertificateIds attribute can be perfomed using Microsoft Graph API. Sample script included below:
<details><summary><b>Show Script</b></summary>
<p>

````PowerShell
function UpdateUserCertIDs {
    Param(
        [String]$UserPrincipalName,
        [ValidateSet("PrincipalName","RFC822Name","X509SKI","X509SHA1PublicKey")]
        [String]$binding,
        [String]$value,
        [Switch]$USGov
    )
  
    switch ($binding) {
        PrincipalName {$pattern = "X509:<PN>"}
        RFC822Name {$pattern = "X509:<RFC822>"}
        X509SKI {$pattern = "X509:<SKI>"}
        X509SHA1PublicKey {$pattern = "X509:<SHA1-PUKEY>"}
    }

    if ($USGov) {$MSGraphURI="https://graph.microsoft.us/beta"} else {"https://graph.microsoft.us/beta"}

    #prepare the value
    $body=@{
        "@odata.context"= "$MSGraphURI/$metadata#users/$entity"
        "authorizationInfo"= @{
            "certificateUserIds"= @(
                $pattern + $value
            )
        }
    }
    write-host -ForegroundColor Yellow "UPDATE: Adding userCertificateIds for $UserPrincipalName. New Value: $CACPrincipalName"
    Update-MgUser -UserId $UserPrincipalName -BodyParameter $body -ErrorAction Stop
}

##### UPDATE PARAMETERS #####
[string]$UPN = "mytestuser@contoso.onmicrosoft.us"
[string]$CACPNValue = "123456789101112@mil"

# Connect to MS Graph (example for Azure AD Government)
Connect-MgGraph -Environment USGov -Scopes User.ReadWrite.All

# Verify value for single user
$user = Get-MgUser -UserId $UPN
$user.AuthorizationInfo.CertificateUserIds

## 2. Optional: Create a Pilot Group
You may want to target a pilot group for Azure AD CBA. For this document, the name `Azure AD CBA Pilot` is used. Use the Azure Portal or Microsoft Graph PowerShell like the example below.

> ðŸ“˜ [Manage groups in the Azure AD Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups)

<details><summary><b>Show Script</b></summary>
<p>

````PowerShell
##### UPDATE PARAMETERS #####
$DisplayName = "Azure AD CBA Pilot"
$MailNickname = "AzureADCBAPilot"
Connect-MGGraph -Environment USGov -Scopes Group.ReadWrite.All
New-MgGroup -DisplayName $DisplayName -MailEnabled:$false -MailNickname $MailNickname -SecurityEnabled:$true
````
</p>
</details>

## 3. Optional: Enable Staged Rollout
If the user belongs to a federated domain (they authenticate to Azure AD using AD FS or some other provider), staged rollout feature must be enabled to interrupt automatic re-direct to the federation service during sign-in.

To configure staged rollout for the Azure AD CBA Pilot group created in the previous step, follow the Microsoft documentation below.

> ðŸ“˜ [Migrate to cloud authentication using Staged Rollout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-staged-rollout)

## 4. Configure the Certification Authorities
This step provides 2 options for configuring the certification authorities:
 - [Option A: Automated Configuration](#option-a-automated-configuration)
 - [Option B: Manual Configuration](#option-b-manual-configuration)

### Option A: Automated Configuration
The automated configuration uses a JSON file pre-populated with the certificate details for the DOD PKI.

1. Download [DODPKI.json](/src/DODPKI.json) from this repository.
2. Copy it to the workstation you will be running the Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets from. Note the file path and update the `$JsonPath` variable in the script parameters.
3. Run the script:

<details><summary><b>Show Script</b></summary>
<p>

```PowerShell
##### UPDATE PARAMETERS #####
$JsonPath = "c:\temp\DODPKI.json"
$CertConfig = Get-Content $JsonPath | ConvertFrom-Json
#############################

#Connect to Azure AD
Connect-AzureAD -AzureEnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment

#Get existing certificate configuration
$TenantCertificates = Get-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority

#Check to see if certificates exist, if not add AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority
foreach ($cert in $Certconfig) {
    if ($cert.Subject -in $TenantCertificates.TrustedIssuer) {
        Write-host "Certificate $($cert.Subject) already exists."
    } else {
        $new_ca=New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.CertificateAuthorityInformation
        $new_ca.AuthorityType=$($cert.authority)
        $new_ca.TrustedCertificate=$(Convert-HexStringToByteArray -String $cert.RawData)
        $new_ca.crlDistributionPoint=$($cert.crl)
    }  
    New-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority -CertificateAuthorityInformation $new_ca
}
```
</p>
</details>

> ðŸ“˜ [Configure certification authorities - New-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#add)

### Option B: Manual Configuration
**Download the certificates and CRL locations**

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the public-facing cyber.mil website: [https://public.cyber.mil/pki-pke/tools-configuration-files/]
2. Download the PKI CA Certificate Bundles (DoD PKI Only). The current version as of January 2023 is version 5.9 found [here](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/pki-pke/zip/certificates_pkcs7_DoD.zip).
3. Expand the ZIP archive.
4. Double-click the .der.p7b file (e.g. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD.der.p7b) to open certmgr.
5. Expand the AppData folder and click **Certificates**
6. Right-click on the certificates listed below, select **All Tasks --> Export...**, select **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)** format, and choose a location to save the file.
    - DoD Root CA 3
    - DoD Root CA 4
    - DoD Root CA 5
    - DOD ID CA-59
    - DOD ID CA-62
    - DOD ID CA-63
    - DOD ID CA-64
    - DOD ID CA-65

> **Note**: There are many additional certificates in **certificates.pkcs7_DoD.zip**, however only the valid (not expired) ID CA certificates and the Root CA certificates are needed. Every CAC certificate valid for smartcard logon, and thus Azure AD CBA, is issued from 1 of the 5 ID CAs as of January 2023.

7. Next, open the latest **DoD and ECA CRL Distribution Points (CRLDPs)** from [https://public.cyber.mil/pki-pke/tools-configuration-files/]. The current version as of January 2023 is [here](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/pki-pke/txt/unclass-dod_eca_crldps_nipr_20210415.txt).
8. Keep this list open for reference.

**Upload the certificates to the Azure AD Portal**

Follow the [manual steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-1-configure-the-certification-authorities) to upload the certificates in the order below:

|No.|Certificate|CRL|Is Root CA|
|---|-----------|---|----------|
|1|DoD Root CA 3|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODROOTCA3.crl|Yes|
|2|DoD Root CA 4|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODROOTCA4.crl|Yes|
|3|DoD Root CA 5|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODROOTCA5.crl|Yes|
|4|DOD ID CA-59|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODIDCA_59.crl|No|
|5|DOD ID CA-62|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODIDCA_62.crl|No|
|6|DOD ID CA-63|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODIDCA_63.crl|No|
|7|DOD ID CA-64|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODIDCA_64.crl|No|
|8|DOD ID CA-65|http://crl.disa.mil/crl/DODIDCA_65.crl|No|

> **Note**: Root Certificates need to be uploaded first and marked as root. If you make a mistake during the process, you will need to delete the certificate from the Azure Portal and upload it again.

> ðŸ“˜ [Configure certification authorities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-1-configure-the-certification-authorities)

## 5. Configure the CBA Authentication Method
Enable the CBA on the Azure AD tenant following the reference below. Use the following settings:

|Setting|Value|
|-------|-----|
|Enable | Yes |
|Target |Select Users - Azure AD CBA Pilot|
|Protection Level|Multi-Factor Authentication|
|Binding Policy | [See step 1](#1-determine-username-mapping-policy).|

> ðŸ“˜ [Enable CBA on the tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-2-enable-cba-on-the-tenant)

## Test signing in with a certificate

> **Warning**: It will take around 30 minutes for settings to propogate for Staged Rollout and Certificate Authorities configuration.

1. Add a user to the `Azure AD CBA Pilot` group. 
2. For cloud-only users, ensure `UserCertificateIds` value is populated with the [appropriate value](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#achieve-higher-security-with-certificate-bindings).
3. Open a web browser and navigate to https://portal.azure.us
4. Sign in with the test user, choosing **certificate authentication**
5. Select the CAC certificate and enter the PIN
6. Verify the user signed in successfully. Reference the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#understanding-the-certificate-based-authentication-error-page) to troubleshoot any issues.

## Preview - Sign in with certificate on mobile device
Mobile devices now support certificate-based authentication in the native browser using certificate stored in the PIV app for Yubikey devices. This new capability differs from previous mobile CBA implementations becuase A) ADFS is not required, B) it is true MFA since PIN / private key is used.

**Useful information**
| Platform | Yubikey Type | OS Requirement | Application Requirement | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------|
| iOS      | NFC, Lightning | iOS 14.2+       | Safari, Yubico Authenticator 17 | Use Yubico Authenticator to load the public key for the certificate into iOS Keychain. After tapping sign-in with certificate, a notification banner for Yubico Authenticaotr will appear. Tap it to provide PIN in the Yubico Authenticator app. Use the breadcrumb in the top left to navigate back to the browser.*|
| iPadOS  | Lightning, USB-C | iPadOS 16 | Safari, Yubico Authentciator | Use Yubico Authenticator to load the public key for the certificate into iOS Keychain. After tapping sign-in with certificate, Safari will launch a PIN prompt in the same browser window. Once PIN is entered and certificate is verified, sign-in will succeed.|
| Android | USB-C (NFC not supported currently) | Android 12 (earlier versions may work) | Chrome |No prerequisites. After tapping sign-in with certificate, Chrome will launch a PIN prompt in the same browser window. Once PIN is entered and certificate is verified, sign-in will succeed.|

> **Warning**: iOS requires notifications enabled for Yubico Authenticator app. Ensure that Focus Modes include Yubico Authenticator to bypass the notification block. When the notification does not succeed, the certificate authentication page (certauth.login.microsoftonline) will hang and time out with TLS error.

## Common Issues
This section covers the common configuration errors that may cause issues with CBA.

|No.|Issue|Cause|Fix|
|---|-----|------------|---|
|1|Timeout fetching CRL|A CRL endpoint was used that is not accessible by the Azure AD logon service.|Use a publicly accessible CRL|
|2|No value in the certificate, as requested by tenant policy, is able to validate the user claim.|<ul><li>The incorrect certificate was selected by the user</li><li>CertificateUserIds for the user is not the correct pattern / value for the certificate</li><li>More than one user has the same certificateUserIds or OnPremisesUserPrincipalName value</li></ul>|Update the Azure AD users so the value on the certificate uniquely maps to the authenticating user.|
|3|Authentication fails because the CRL is invalid.|The CRL found at the CRL location is for a different certificate.|Delete the certificate and upload again, specifying the proper CRL location.|
|4|Authentication fails with an MFA errof.|X509 Authentication Method is a primary Authentication method that does not support a second factor like Azure MFA.|Set the CBA Authentication Method to "multi-factor authentication".
|5|Users get prompted for a password when they don't have one|The first authentication after CBA is enabled will show a password prompt for Azure AD with **Sign in with certificate** link.|Once the user has signed in, the browser will remember the method selected and further authentication prompts will simply show "Use a certificate or smart card" without password field.|
