# Azure Active Directory Baseline Configuration for MLZ
This document provides key steps for deploying and securing Azure Active Directory for Mission Landing Zone.

> **Note**:
Some steps require Azure AD P2 licensing for privileged users within the environment. Alternative steps are included in case licenses are not available during initial configuration.

## Prepare a secure workstation for managing Azure AD
There are several client tools for managing Azure AD configuration. Make sure you are managing Azure and Azure AD from a secure workstation. Ensure these privileged access devices include the Azure management tools outlined in this section. 

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Privileged Access Devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/privileged-access-devices)

## Install Azure Management Tools
Install the following tools locally to the Azure management workstation:
- [Azure Command-Line-Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Az PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-9.0.1)
  - `Install-Module Az`
- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0)
  - `Install-Module Microsoft.Graph`
- [Azure AD PowerShell v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0)
  - `Install-Module AzureADPreview`

## Create the first Global Administrator
Log in with an account that is a [Global Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) within the tenant. Usually, the first user that created the Azure AD tenant will be a guest / external user. This can be verified by navigating to the Users blade in the Azure AD Portal and investigating the **User Type** field. 

If the signed in account is not a **member** type, follow the steps below:
1. [Add a new user in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory#add-a-new-user)
   a. Record the username, including the domain suffix
   b. Note the temporary password
2. [Assign Global Administrator role to the new user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal)
3. Sign out of the portal or click the profile in the top right and select **sign in with a different account**
4. Enter the username and temporary password for the first member administrator account.
5. Change the password to a [strong password value](https://www.nist.gov/video/password-guidance-nist-0)
6. Register security information when prompted. This will secure the administrator account and provide a means for resetting the password.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Azure AD Setup Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2183427)

## License the first Global Administrator
1. Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com | https://portal.azure.us) as the first Global Administrator
2. Search for "Azure Active Directory" and click the Azure AD icon to open the AAD Administration "blade" in the Azure Portal.
3. Click **Licenses** and then **All Products**
4. Make sure you see the expected licenses.
5. Assign the first administrator an Azure AD Premium license.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure AD Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups?)

## Connect to the Azure AD Tenant with Microsoft Graph PowerShell
Open PowerShell and run the following command to connect to Azure AD:
- Azure AD Commercial
  - `Connect-MgGraph -scope TBD`
- Azure AD Government
  - `Connect-MgGraph -Environment UsGov -scope TBD`
- Azure AD Government - DoD
  - `Connect-MgGraph -Environment UsGovDoD -scope TBD`

# 2. Create Accounts for Azure Management
This section covers account creation for Emergency Access and day-to-day Azure AD administration.

- [ ] [Emergency Access Accounts](#emergency-access-accounts)
- [ ] [Named Administrators](#named-administrator-accounts)

## Emergency Access Accounts
When a new Azure AD tenant is created, the user who created the tenant is the only user in the directory with administrative privileges. The first thing we need to do is create 2 Emergency Access accounts, 1 of which will be excluded from multi-factor authentication in case the Azure MFA service is degrated.

- [ ] [Set Password Protection Policy](#set-password-protection-policy)
- [ ] [Create Accounts](#create-accounts)
- [ ] [Document and Test Emergency Access Procedures](#document-and-test-emergency-access-procedures)
- [ ] [Connect Azure AD logs to Microsoft Sentinel and set up alerts](#connect-azure-ad-logs-to-microsoft-sentinel-and-set-up-alerts)

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference:** [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access)

### Set Password Protection Policy
Configure banned password list using [Azure AD Password Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad)
`Placeholder Script to set policy to whatever the STIG is`

### Create Accounts
Add cloud-only user accounts for initial Global Administrators.
`Placeholder Script to create the accounts with random complex password`

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Add or delete users in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory)

**Azure AD Free or Premium P1**
For Azure AD Free or Premium P1, assign the Global Administrator Azure Active Directory Role.

`Placeholder Script to create accounts and assign Global Administrator role`

**Azure AD Premium P2**
If Azure AD Premium P2 is available in the tenant, activate the premium features and assign the Global Administrator role using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

1. Enable Privileged Identity Management
2. Enable Identity Protection
3. Assign Global Administrator Role using PIM to the Emergency Access Accounts

`Placeholder Script to Assign Global Administrator role with PIM`

### Document and Test Emergency Access Procedures
Creation and secure storage for Emergency Access credentials is useless if the emergency procedures to retrieve and use the Emergency Access accounts is not properly documented and disseminated to all individuals who may be tasked with using the accounts.

> **Note**: Consult your Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) for proper handling procedures for Emergency Access accounts.

**Recommendations**:
- Record passwords for Emergency Access accounts legibly by hand (do not type or send to a printer)
- Store passwords for Emergency Access accounts in a safe that resides in a physically secure location.
- Do not save passwords to an Enterprise password vault or Privleged Access Management (PAM) system
- Do not save passwords to a personal password vault (LastPass, Apple Keychain, Google, OnePassword, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.)
- Store backup copies for Emergency Access account credentials in a geographic distant location.
- Exclude at least 1 Emergency Access account from Azure MFA
- Monitor and alert on Emergency Access account usage

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Manage Emergency Access Accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access)

### Connect Azure AD Logs to Microsoft Sentinel and set up alerts
If you are configuring Azure AD for MLZ after the MLZ deployment, leverage the existing Microsoft Sentinel deployment in the Operations subscription to alert on Emergency Account usage.

1. [Connect Azure AD Sign-In Logs to Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory)
2. [Configure an Analytics Rule to alert when Emergency Access account is used](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access#monitor-sign-in-and-audit-logs)

## Named Administrator Accounts
Day-to-day operations requiring administrative privileges should be performed by named administrator accounts, assigned to individual users (not shared), separate from accounts used to access productivity services like Email, SharePoint, and Teams.
- [ ] [Choose a naming convention](#choose-a-naming-convention)
- [ ] [Create cloud-only identities](#create-azure-ad-cloud-only-identities)
- [ ] [Configure phishing-resistant MFA](#configure-phishing-resistant-mfa)

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations**:
> - Administration for Azure and Azure AD should use cloud-only identities and Azure AD native authentication mechanism, like FIDO2 security keys or smartcard certificates.
> - Limit the number of Global Administrators, referring to [least privileged roles by task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-by-task) to assign the proper limited administrator role
> - Assign permissions Just-In-Time using [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)
> - Periodically review role eligibility
> - Leverage PIM [insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-security-wizard) and [alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-configure-security-alerts) to further secure your organization
> - Review [Privileged Access Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/groups-features) and [Administrative Units](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/administrative-units)

### Choose a naming convention
Choose a naming convention for cloud-only administrative accounts:
- FirstName+"."+LastName+@tenant.onmicrosoft.com
- FirstInitial+LastName+@tenant.onmicrosoft.com
- "adm." + FirstInitial+LastName@tenant.onmicrosoft.com
- other

### Create Azure AD cloud-only identities
1. Create users in the Azure Portal or using Microsoft Graph PowerShell. 
2. Provide the temporary password for each new admin.
3. Instruct the admin to change password and [register security info](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/set-up-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-as-your-verification-method-33452159-6af9-438f-8f82-63ce94cf3d29) by setting Microsoft Authenticator App as a verification method.

### Configure phishing-resistant MFA
Configure phishing-resistant strong authentication with Azure AD. Review the list below:

- **Bad:** SMS or TwoWayPhone
Some MFA is better than no MFA, but phone-based MFA is the weakest option available. SMS is especially egregious since it is susceptable to [SIM swapping attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam).
- **Good:** Authenticator App TOTP Code or Push notification
These methods are not phishing-resistant or passwordless. In either case, a password is used, followed by an Azure MFA prompt.
- **Better:** Passwordless Phone Sign-In on Registered Device
Passwordless, but not phishing-resistant. This required registration of an iOS or Android mobile device with the Azure AD tenant.
- **Best:** Phishing-Resistant MFA FIDO2 Security Key or Azure AD native Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)
  - FIDO2 Security Key
  - Azure AD Native Certificate-Based Authentication
  - Windows Hello for Business

> **Note**: Microsoft Authenticator App is considered phishing-resistant when deployed to a managed mobile device. Since this guide is for setting up a new tenant, it assumes Microsoft Endpoint Manager is not configured to manage mobile devices.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Phishing-resistant methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/standards/memo-22-09-multi-factor-authentication#phishing-resistant-methods)

# 3. Configure Authentication Methods
Azure AD authenticaton methods allow an administrator to configure how users can authenticate to Azure AD.

- [ ] [Enable Microsoft Authenticator](#enable-microsoft-authenticator-app)
- [ ] [Enable FIDO2 Security Keys](#enable-fido2-security-keys)
- [ ] [Configure Azure AD Certificate-Based Authentication](#configure-azure-ad-native-certificate-based-authentication)

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [What authentication verification methods are available in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)

## Enable Microsoft Authenticator app
The Microsoft Authenticator app for iOS and Android lets users authenticate / complete MFA challenges when Azure AD configuration (Conditional Access or Security Defaults) needs an additional factor. The Microsoft Authenticator app can be used in the following ways:
- Passwordless Phone Sign-in
- Notification
- Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) code

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Microsoft Authenticator app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app)

## Enable FIDO2 security keys
FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that come in different form factors. Most security keys resemble a USB thumb drive and communicate with device over USB.

## Configure Azure AD Native Certificate-Based Authentication
Organizations that need to use smartcard (certificate-based) authentication with Azure AD should configure Azure AD Native Certificate-Based Authentication settings in Azure AD. This feature is in Public Preview and is subject to change. Follow the latest documentation to configure from the reference below.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Azure AD Native Certificate-Based Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication)

# 4. Create MLZ RBAC Security Groups
Use this set of Azure AD Security Groups and RBAC role assignments as a baseline.
- [ ] [Azure Resource RBAC](#azure-resource-rbac)
- [ ] [Azure AD Directory Roles](#azure-ad-directory-roles)
- [ ] [Create Security Groups](#create-azure-ad-security-groups)
- [ ] [Map MLZ RBAC Security Groups to Azure RBAC Roles](#map-mlz-rbac-security-groups-to-azure-rbac-roles)
- [ ] [Review Securing Privileged Access in Azure AD](#review-securing-privileged-access-in-azure-ad)

## Azure Resource RBAC
Permissions for Azure resource management are granted through assignments to an Azure RBAC role. In the Azure Portal, RBAC role assignments can be created or viewed by selecting the IAM link. Azure RBAC assignments can apply to users (members and guests), security groups, service principals, and managed identities. 

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Assign permissions to Azure AD security groups. If Azure AD Premium P2 licesing is available, configure the security groups eligble for the Azure RBAC role assignments.

Azure RBAC can be assigned at any of the following scopes:
 - Management Group
   - Subscription
     - Resource Group
       - Resource

|Name|Usage|RBAC Role |Role Type|Scope|
|----|-----|----------|---------|--------------|
|Azure Platform Owner|Management Group and subscription lifecycle management|Owner|Built-in|Management Group|
|Security Operations|View and update permissions for Microsoft Defender for Cloud|Security Admin|Built-in|Subscription|
|Subscription Owner|Grants full access to manage all resources, including ability to assign roles with RBAC |Owner|Built-in|Subscription|
|Subscription Owner no Network Write|Delegated role for subscription owner that prohibits ability to manage role assignments and routes.SubscriptionOwnerNoNetwork|Custom|Subscription|
|Subscription Contributor|insert blurb|Contributor|Built-in|Subscription|
|Subscription Reader|insert blurb|Reader|Built-in|Subscription|
|Application Owners (DevOps)|Contributor role granted at resource group.|DevOpsAppOps|Custom|Resource Group|

## Azure AD Directory Roles
In addition to Azure AD roles, there are several Azure AD Directory roles that may be needed. These roles can be assigned to users, groups (if group is role-assignable), and service principals.

Azure AD RBAC can be assigned at any of the following scopes:
 - Directory (default)
   - Administrative Unit
   - Azure AD Resource (Group or Application Owner)

 > ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Start by assigning Global Administrator role for Emergency Access accounts and tenant admins. When other Azure AD permissions are required, assign users using [least-privileged role by task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-by-task). Review the insights and recommendations provided by Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

|Name|Usage|
|----|-----|
|Application Developer|Register applications with Azure AD.|
|Application Administrator|Manage all Enterprise Applications in Azure AD.|
|Hybrid Identity Administrator|Configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize identities from AD DS to Azure AD|

**Azure AD Free or Premium P1**
Assign users directly to Azure AD roles.

**Azure AD Premium P2**
Create [Role-Assignable Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept) and assign eligibility to Azure AD directory roles using Privileged Identity Management (PIM).

The following role-assignable groups are used in the AAD Configuration Baseline:
|Name|Usage|AAD Role|Role Type|Scope|
|----|-----|--------|---------|-----|
|Groups Administrator|Azure AD role assignment for managing groups|Groups Administrator|Built-in AAD Role|Global|
|Mission RBAC Role Manager|Privileged Access Group|AAD Role for Groups Administrator|Administrative Unit|
|Application Developers|Azure AD role assignment for app registration|Application Developers|Built-in AAD Role|Global|
|Hybrid Identity Admins|Configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize identities from AD DS to Azure AD|Global

> **Note**: These security group and role assignments represent baseline configuration. Modify with additional roles as needed, starting with built-in roles when possible.

## Create Azure AD Security Groups
Run the script below to create Azure AD security groups:
`$groups = @() #Update for all groups`
`New-MGGroup -Example`

## Map MLZ RBAC Security Groups to Azure RBAC Roles
Once the groups are created, map them to the relevant RBAC role.

**Azure AD Free or Premium P1**
`Script`

**Azure AD Premium P2**
Azure AD Premium P2 customers should map security groups eligible for roles using Privileged Identity Management (PIM). Choose an elevation duration and access review interval.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommended Settings**:
> - Global Administrator
>    - **Elevation Duration:** 2 hours
>    - **Approvals Required:** Yes
>    - **Notification:** Yes
> - Other Roles
>    - **Duration:** 4 hours
>    - **Approval Required:** No
>    - **Notification:** Yes

`Script`

## Review Securing Privileged Access in Azure AD
Familiarize yourself with the Securing Privileged Access guidance for Azure AD and build a plan for handling privileged access to the Mission Landing Zone environment.

> **Reference**: [Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-planning)

# 5. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication and disable Legacy Authentication Protocols
This section enables key recommended access policies for all apps protected by Azure AD. This includes the Azure portal, Microsoft Graph, Azure Resource Manager, M365 applications, and any future applications integrated with Azure AD.

**Azure AD Free - Turn on Security Defaults**
Azure AD Free offers a feature called Security Defaults. This feature performs basic security configuration for the Azure AD platform. To enable security defaults, see [Enable Security Defaults](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults).

`Script`

**Azure AD Premium P1 and P2 - Create Conditional Access Policies**
Create the following Conditional Access policies:

1. [Block Legacy Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy)
2. [Require MFA for All Users all Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa)

> **Note**: If you are configuring [hybrid identity](#9-optional-configure-hybrid-identity), make sure exclude the Azure AD account used for AAD Connect Synchronization from the MFA policy.

**Azure AD Premium P2 - Configure Risk-Based Conditional Access Policies**
Enable the following [risk-based Conditional Access Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies):
1. Require password change when User Risk is **High**
2. Create Conditional Access rule to Block Registering Security Info when sign-in risk is **High**

`script`

> **Note**: If Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune) will be deployed for the Azure AD tenant used by MLZ, enroll privileged access devices and use [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/create-conditional-access-intune) to require a compliant device for Azure Management.

# 6. Configure User, Group, and External Collaboration Settings
This section contains basic tenant-level settings applicable to all Azure AD versions. The MLZ baseline AAD script will set these configuration items according to the defaults outlined in each section. This configuration can be changed at any time. The baseline settings represent a starting point, and may not be functional for certain scenarios. For example, tenants that will be accessed by guests from another tenant must set the External Collaboration settings accordingly. The baseline offers a most restrictive experience, which turns off these collaboration features.

- [ ] [User Settings](#user-settings)
- [ ] [Group Settings](#group-settings)
- [ ] [External Collaboration Settings](#external-collaboration-settings)

## User Settings
The MLZ AAD baseline will set the following Azure AD user settings:

|Setting|MLZ-Baseline|
|-------|--------|
|Users can register applications|No|
|Restrict Access to the Azure AD Admin Portal|Yes|
|Users can use preview features for My Apps|Yes|
|Combined Security Registration|Yes (Default)|
|Administrators can access My Staff|Yes (All)|
|Allow users to connect their account to LinkedIn|No|
|Users can add gallery apps to My Apps|No|
|Users can request admin consent for apps|No|

`script`
> **Note**: Some settings are set during tenant creation and cannot be changed. All settings may not be available in Azure AD Government.

## Group Settings
The MLZ AAD baseline will set the following Azure AD group settings:
|Setting|MLZ-Baseline|
|-------|------------|
|Owners can manage group membership requests in the Access Panel|Yes|
|Restrict user ability to access group features in the access panel|No|
|Users can create security groups|No|
|Users can create M365 groups|No|
|Group Naming Policy Prefix|Baseline script parameter|
|Group Naming Policy Suffix|Baseline script parameter|

`script`

## External Collaboration Settings
MLZ AAD baseline will set the following Azure AD external collaboration settings:
|Setting|MLZ-Baseline|
|-------|------------|
|Guest user access|Most Restricted|
|Guest invitations|Most Restrictive (no one can invite)|
|Enable guest self-service|No|
|Allow external users to leave|Yes|
|Invitation restrictions|Most Restrictive|

`script`

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Default user permissions in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

# 7. Optional: Add a custom domain to Azure AD
When an Azure AD tenant is created, a default domain is assigned that looks like *tenantname.onmicrosoft.com* (*tenantname.onmicrosoft.us* for Azure AD Government). By default, all users in Azure AD get a UserPrincipalName (UPN) with the default domain suffix.

[Custom domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-custom-domain) let tenant administrators change the UPN suffix by verifying ownership of an organization's DNS domain via TXT record.

`script`

> **Note**:
Sometimes when custom domains are added to an Azure AD tenant, users who signed up for trial Microsoft services with their organization email address will appear in the tenant once the domain is verified. Do not be alarmed by this. To verify no other users have privileges within the tenant, [view the Azure AD role members](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/view-assignments).

# 8. Choose a Hybrid Identity Configuration
Microsoftâ€™s identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities. These solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources. This configuration has 2 parts:
- [ ] [Synchronization](#synchronization)
- [ ] [Authentication](#authentication)

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [What is hybrid identity with Azure AD?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity)

## Synchronization
Hybrid identity should be configured if an organization uses Active Directory Domain Services and wishes to synchronize users and groups to Azure AD. Microsoft offers 2 tools (named very similarly) to accomolish this function:
- [Azure AD Connect](#azure-ad-connect-v2)
- [Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync](#azure-ad-connect-cloud-sync)

Which tool you should use varies depending on the hybrid identity needs for the environment. Use Cloud Sync for simple scenarios if it supports the features your organization needs. For a full breakdown of feature support between the tools, see [Comparison between Azure AD Conect and Cloud Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync#comparison-between-azure-ad-connect-and-cloud-sync).

> **Note**: Synchronizing all identities to Azure AD helps establish an enterprise identity and zero trust surface for all applications. If hybrid identity is already configured for a different tenant, treat that tenant as the enterprise Azure AD for the organization. Review the tenant types.


### Azure AD Connect v2
[Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect-v2) is the latest version of Microsoft's on-premises infrastructure based synchronization tool. 

Use Azure AD Connect Sync if:
- You want to synchronize identites from Active Directory Domain Services or a generic LDAP database to Azure AD
- You need to configure a hybrid authentication option other than Password Hash Sync
- You need to synchronize device objects for Hybrid Azure AD Join
- You need to configure Exchange hybrid or group writeback
- You need to synchronize extension attributes
- You need to synchronize large groups with > 250,000 members
- You have over 150,000 objects to synchronize
- You wish to leverage Azure AD Domain Serices (only applicable when used with password hash synchronization)

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: (Choose the right authentication method for your Azure AD hybrid identity solution)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn]

### Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync
[Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync) is an agent-based synchronization tool managed in Azure AD. This tool is expected to replace Azure AD Connect sync for most scenarios.

Use Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync if:
- You want to synchronize identities from Active Directory Domain Services to Azure AD
- You are configuring Password Hash Sync or cloud-native Azure AD authentication with security keys, authenticator app, or certificates.
- You will be joining devices directly to Azure AD and do not need hybrid join functionality
- You do not need to synchronize extension attributes
- You do not need to filter using attribute values (Organizational Unit filtering only)
- You do not need complex or custom attribute synchronization logic

### Exclude sync account from Multi-Factor authentication Conditional Access Policy
Once a synchronization tool is configured, you should see initial synchronization fails due to single-factor authentication. Ensure this account is excluded from any MFA requirements set by Conditional Access policy. See [user exclusions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa#user-exclusions).

## Authentication
Hybrid identity configuration can include [Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-phs) where passwords are replicated from Active Directory to Azure AD. This is only applicable for AD environments where users have and use a password. If users access AD-protected resources with a smartcard (CAC/PIV), there is no need to set up password hash sync.

Pass-Through Authentication (PTA) and federation with ADFS are not recommended. Hybrid authentication is less secure than Azure AD native methods, as the on-premises environment represents a significant identity attack surface.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Use Azure AD native strong authentication method, like FIDO2 security keys or native certificate-based authentication, for administration of Azure and Azure AD.

# 9. Configure Additional Features
- [ ] [Group-Based Licenensing](#group-based-licensing)
- [ ] [Authentication Strength](#authentication-strength-preview)
- [ ] [Cross-Tenant Access Policies (XTAP)](#cross-tenant-access-policies-xtap-and-b2b-cross-cloud-collaboration)
- [ ] [Identity Governance (IGA)](#identity-governance)

## Group-Based Licensing
Group-based licensing is an Azure AD Premium feauture that automatically applied licenses to members of a security group. Creating [dynamic groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-create-rule) can further automate this process, since these groups are populated based on user attribute values. To use group-based licensing, follow steps in [assign licenses to a group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-groups-assign).

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Group-based licensing with PowerShell and Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-ps-examples)

## Authentication Strength (Preview)
Authentication Strengths is a feature that allows a tenant administrator to label authenticators (and combinations) according to the strength of the credential. Out-of-Box settings include:
- Multifactor Authentication
- Passwordless Multifactor Authentication
- Phishing-Resistant MFA

Additional strengths, like NIST Authenticator Assurance Levels, can be configured by an administrator.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: Configure Authentication Strength](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths)

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Configure desired MFA strength for baseline access and update the 'All Users, All Apps, MFA' Conditional Access Policy to require Authentication Strength.

## Cross-Tenant Access Policies (XTAP) and B2B Cross-Cloud Collaboration
Cross-tenant access policies (XTAP) let an administrator configure "trust" relationships with other Azure AD tenants. This allows trusting device compliance and MFA claims for external users for a more secure and productive collaboration experience. Similar settings can be configured between Azure AD Commercial tenant and an Azure AD Government tenant. Cross-cloud collaboration requires setting Inbound and Outbound XTAP settings on the respective tenants.

## Administrative Units and Custom Roles
Administrative Units provide a mechanism for scoping Azure AD roles to a particular set of resources. AUs can be scoped to users, groups, and devices. Resources can be assigned to an AU manually, or the AU can be configured with dynamic rules. Refer to the documentation below to learn about AUs and their use cases for scoping / delegating administration in Azure AD.

> **Note**: Not all out-of-box Azure AD roles can be scoped to an AU. Review the [limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/administrative-units#groups) for Administrative Units.

# 10. Connect Applications to Azure AD
One of the first steps an organization can take in adopting zero trust principals is consolidating around a single cloud-based Identity as a Service (IdaaS) platform like Azure Active Directory. This section describes steps to integrate applications with Azure AD.

- [ ] [Consolidate around an Azure AD tenant](#consolidate-around-an-azure-ad-tenant)
- [ ] [Add Enterprise Applications to Azure AD](#add-enterprise-applications-to-azure-ad)
- [ ] [Develop New Applications for Azure AD](#develop-new-applications-for-azure-ad)
- [ ] [Add On-Premises Applications to Azure AD](#add-on-premises-applications-to-azure-ad)

## Consolidate around an Azure AD tenant
Standardizing around a common identity platform often requires changes to IT policy mandating new applications (procured and developed in house) targets Azure Active Directory. The Azure AD tenant containing all users in the organization, especially if it is used for M365, is a good choice because the same zero trust access and device management policies for M365 can be re-used for any application in the organization.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: 
> - Zero Trust policies for application identity should be drafted and implemented as soon as Azure Active Directory is ready.
> - Applications should be migrated from on-premises based federation services like Active Directory Federation Services.
> - Integrate as many signals as possible (device, user, application, context, authentication strength, risk) into Azure AD Conditional Access.

## Add Enterprise Applications to Azure AD
Enterprise Apps are application resources assigned to users in your Azure Active Directory. Add applications from the Azure AD Gallery or add non-gallery apps that use SAML, WS-Federation, OpenID Connect, or OAuth protocols.

> ðŸ“˜ **Reference**: [Overview of the Azure Active Directory application gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/overview-application-gallery)

## Develop New Applications for Azure AD
Develop new applications and APIs to use Azure AD for authentication and authorization.

## Add On-Premises Applications to Azure AD
Azure AD Application Proxy is an on-premises agent and cloud service that [securely publishes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-security) on-premises applications that use [Kerberos-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-with-kcd), [password-based]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-password-vaulting), [SAML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-on-premises-apps), and [header-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-with-headers) authentication protocols. This feature allows organizations to gain [single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-config-sso-how-to) and zero trust security controls for existing applications, without expensive network appliances or VPNs. Remote access to on-premises applications is achieved without code change to applications or opening inbound ports for the external firewall.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**:
> - [Deploy Azure AD Application Proxy connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-deployment-plan) to every Active Directory domain containing users or applications that must be published externally. 
> - If a [Secure Hybrid Access Partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/secure-hybrid-access#secure-hybrid-access-through-azure-ad-partner-integrations) solution is already in use for the organization, integrate the solution with Azure Active Directory.
